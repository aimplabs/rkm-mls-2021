# Machine Learning Systems, 2021   
**Computer Science (Year II) and Big Data Analytics (Year I)**   
**Ramakrishna Mission & Vivekananda Educational Research Institute (RKMVERI)**      
**Kolkata, India**  

This course aims to teach the fundamental principles of various machine learning and deep learning techniques with a major emphasis on how such techniques find applications in numerous engineering systems. The course is divided into three parts: computing and system components, classical machine learning, and deep learning with PyTorch. The emphasis of this course is on practical applications, however, there will be opportunities to explore theoretical connections depending on the students' interest. 

## Part I: Computing and System Components

This part of the course starts by explaning how to set up a machine learning lab in a linux (ubuntu) system. Important and useful tools for virtualization and collaborations are demonstrated. The part of the course places major emphasis on practical and systems related features of python, including various libraries and modules of pythonic ecosystem. A quick tour of supervised and unsupervised machine learning gives the students a bird's eye view of the field, and what follows next is a series of demonstrations of multiple system components to build and deploy machine learning applications. 

* Chapter 1 Setting up Machine Learning Lab

* **Chapter 2** Fundamental python (system view) and numerical python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)

* **Chapter 3** Introduction to supervised machine learning; Regression

* **Chapter 4** Classification; logistic regression

* **Chapter 5** Cross-validation technique and overfitting control

* **Chapter 6** Introduction to unsupervised learning; Clustering with K-Means

* **Chapter 7** Dimensionality reduction and manifold learning; principal component analysis

* Chapter 8 Introduction to natural language processing (classification and sentiment analysis)

* Chapter 9 Introduction to computer vision 

* **Chapter 10** Advanced Python I: functional programming, generators, exception handling

* **Chapter 11** Advanced Python II: Object-oriented Python

* Chapter 12 Frontend systems: introduction to HTML and CSS; visualization and data dashboard

* Chapter 13 Database systems: Scaling up database computation with python connectors

* Chapter 14 Backend system development with Python-flask

* Chapter 15 API systems: interaction and development 


## Part II: Machine Learning Theory

Having seen machine learning from a very practical and systems perspective in the previous section we take this opportunity in this section to dive deeper into the theory of machine learning.   

* **Chapter 1** Bayesian view of parameter estimation; MLE and MAP estimation; regularization; 

* **Chapter 2** Classification with Naive Bayes (Bernoulli, Multinomial, and Gaussian features)

* Chapter 3 Regression (least square) in computer vision I (single object tracking  - Theory)

* Chapter 4 Regression (least square) in computer vision II (single object tracking - Practicals)


## Part III: Deep Learning with PyTorch
This part of the course studies deep learning with the help of PyTorch library.  

* **Chapter 1** Deep learning fundamentals

* **Chapter 2** Deep Learning with Pytorch (Multilayer perceptron) 

* **Chapter 3** Deep Learning with Pytorch (Convolutional neural network)
