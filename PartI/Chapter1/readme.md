This part of the course starts by explaning how to set up a machine learning lab in a linux (ubuntu) system. Important and useful tools for virtualization and collaborations are demonstrated. The part of the course places major emphasis on practical and systems related features of python, including various libraries and modules of pythonic ecosystem. A quick tour of supervised and unsupervised machine learning gives the students a bird's eye view of the field, and what follows next is a series of demonstrations of multiple system components to build and deploy machine learning applications.
