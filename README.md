## Ramakrishna Mission & Vivekananda Educational Research Institute (RKMVERI)
## Kolkata, India

This course aims to teach the fundamental principles of various machine learning and deep learning techniques with a major emphasis on how such techniques find applications in numerous engineering systems. The course is divided into three parts: computing and system components, classical machine learning, and deep learning with PyTorch. The emphasis of this course is on practical applications, however, there will be opportunities to explore theoretical connections depending on the students' interest. 

## Part I: Computing and System Components

This part of the course starts by explaning how to set up a machine learning lab in a linux (ubuntu) system. Important and useful tools for virtualization and collaborations are demonstrated. The part of the course places major emphasis on practical and systems related features of python, including various libraries and modules of pythonic ecosystem. A quick tour of supervised and unsupervised machine learning gives the students a bird's eye view of the field, and what follows next is a series of demonstrations of multiple system components to build and deploy machine learning applications. 

* Chapter 1 Setting up ML lab; importance of virtualization; environment and OS level virtualization; virtual enevironment; docker; version control and collaboration with git & github (e.g., assignment submission); jupyter framework

* Chapter 2 Fundamental Python (system view) and numerical python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)

* Chapter 3 Types of machine learning; introduction to supervised machine learning; regression; OLS; Curve fitting with polynomial regression; gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent

* Chapter 4 Classification; logistic regression; gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent

* Chapter 5 Bayesian view of parameter estimation; MLE and MAP estimation; regularization; regularized least square (ridge regression); regularized logistic regression

* Chapter 6 Cross-validation technique: train-test split; overfitting control

* Chapter 7 Introduction to unsupervised learning; clustering and dimensionality reduction as examples; Clustering with K-Means

* Chapter 8 Dimensionality reduction and manifold learning; principal component analysis

* Chapter 9 Introduction to natural language processing (classification and sentiment analysis)

* Chapter 10 Introduction to computer vision (convolution, correlation, template matching, discrete Fourier transform)

* Chapter 11 Advanced Python I: functional programming, generators, exception handling

* Chapter 12 Advanced Python II: object-oriented Python, decorators, overloading, polymorphism, repr vs str methods

* Chapter 13 Frontend systems: introduction to HTML and CSS; visualization and data dashboard

* Chapter 14 Database systems: MySQL and Sqlite; scaling up database computation with python connectors

* Chapter 15 Backend system development with Python-flask

* Chapter 16 API systems: interaction and development 


## Part II: Machine Learning 
Having seen machine learning from a very practical and systems perspective in teh previous section we take this opportunity to dive deeper into the theory of machine learning in this part.   

* Chapter 1 Classification with Naive Bayes (Bernoulli, Multinomial, and Gaussian features)

* Chapter 2 Regression (least square) in computer vision I (MOSSE filter for single object tracking  - Theory)

* Chapter 3 Regression (least square) in computer vision II (MOSSE filter for single object tracking - Practicals)


## Part III: Deep Learning with PyTorch
This part of the course studies deep learning with the help of PyTorch library.  

* Chapter 1 Deep learning fundamentals: forward pass, functional composition, gradients from chain rule (backpropagation), parameter updates

* Chapter 2 Deep Learning with Pytorch (Multilayer perceptron) 

* Chapter 3 Deep Learning with Pytorch (Convolutional neural network)
