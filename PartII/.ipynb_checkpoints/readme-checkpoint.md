Having seen machine learning from a very practical and systems perspective in the previous section we take this opportunity to dive deeper into the theory of machine learning in this part.

## Part II: Machine Learning Theory

Having seen machine learning from a very practical and systems perspective in the previous section we take this opportunity in this section to dive deeper into the theory of machine learning.
